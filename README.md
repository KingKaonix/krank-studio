**KRANK STUDIO** is a professional-grade, low-latency guitar effects processor and audio toolkit for Android. Built from the ground up with a hybrid C++ audio engine and a premium hardware-amp-inspired UI, it delivers studio-quality sound processing directly on your phone or tablet — no cloud, no latency, no compromises.

## Why KRANK STUDIO?

### vs. ToneStack Pro
| Feature | KRANK STUDIO | ToneStack Pro |
|---|---|---|
| **Latency** | < 10ms (Oboe exclusive mode) | 15-25ms |
| **Chromatic Tuner** | 12 tuning presets + cents needle | Basic tuner |
| **Tone Matcher** | WAV/MP3 analysis → auto-effect tuning | Manual only |
| **Song Transcriber** | Audio → tablature generation | ❌ |
| **IR Loader** | Convolution cab sim | ❌ |
| **WAV Recording** | Direct-to-flac float recording | Limited |
| **UI** | Hardware amp aesthetic, glass cards | Generic icons |
| **File Support** | WAV + MP3 + AAC + OGG + FLAC | WAV only |
| **Mic Recording** | Live capture → analyze/transcribe | ❌ |
| **Price** | Free | $9.99+ per amp pack |

### vs. AmpliTube Mobile
- **8 effects in one signal chain** vs AmpliTube's 4-slot limit on mobile
- **Real-time transcription** — play a riff, get tablature instantly
- **Tone matching from any audio file** — dial in any tone you hear
- **No in-app purchases** — every feature is included
- **Open source** — inspect the DSP, contribute, customize

### vs. BIAS FX Mobile
- **Native C++ engine** with Oboe — lower latency than BIAS's cross-platform layer
- **Full-duplex processing** — use your phone as a live rig
- **Chromatic tuner with strobe-style display** — accurate to ±1 cent
- **Song transcription from MP3/WAV** — learn songs by loading the track

## Features

### Audio Engine
- **< 10ms round-trip latency** — Oboe in exclusive mode with 256-frame buffer
- **48 kHz / 32-bit float** internal processing
- **Full-duplex** input/output — play and hear yourself in real time
- **Convolution reverb** with impulse response loading (WAV cab sims)

### Effects Chain — 8 Studio Effects
| Effect | Parameters | Accent Color |
|---|---|---|
| **Distortion** | Drive, Tone, Level | Red |
| **Amp Sim** | Drive, Tone, Level | Teal |
| **EQ** | Bass, Mid, Treble | Blue |
| **Chorus** | Rate, Depth, Mix | Sage |
| **Noise Gate** | Threshold, Attack, Release | Purple |
| **Compressor** | Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release | Pink |
| **Delay** | Mix, Feedback, Time | Yellow |
| **Reverb** | Size, Mix | Gold |

Each effect has independent bypass switching and parameter control via precision sliders with real-time value readouts.

### 5 Amp Presets
Clean → Crunch → Lead → Metal → Ambient — instant tone switching with per-preset effect configurations.

### Chromatic Tuner
- 12 tuning presets: Standard, Drop D, Drop C, Open D, Open G, Open E, DADGAD, Half-Step Down, Full-Step Down, Drop B, Open A, Custom
- Strobe-style note display with pulsing glow ring
- Needle cents indicator with color zones (green = in tune, yellow = close, red = off)
- Frequency readout accurate to 0.1 Hz
- Real-time note detection with audio processing

### Tone Matcher
Load any audio file (WAV, MP3, AAC, OGG, FLAC) or record from your mic — KRANK analyzes the spectral content and recommends optimal effect settings to match the target tone:
- Distortion drive/tone/level
- Amp Sim gain/tone/master
- EQ bass/mid/treble
- Chorus rate/depth/mix
- Delay mix/feedback/time
- Reverb size/mix

### Song Transcriber
Load a WAV or MP3 of a guitar part — the YIN-based monophonic pitch detection engine transcribes audio into standard tablature with fret positions, string assignments, and timing.

### WAV Recording
Record your playing directly to high-quality WAV files (32-bit float, 48 kHz) with a single tap.

### IR Loader (Cab Sim)
Load impulse response WAV files for convolution-based cabinet simulation.
